I've been wanting to learn .NET Core and Entity Framework for a while, and I saw the opportunity to do so when I came across a code assignment in which it was asked to implement a simple car parking system. It's a work in progress but the features I've implemented so far include:

- CRUD operations for parking lots, parking floors and parking spots.
- Parking a vehicle in the next available space (and preventing it from entering if there are no free spaces).

I've been focusing primarily on backend development, since that's where my main interests lie.
